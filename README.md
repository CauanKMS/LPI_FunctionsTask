<h3>Task: Functions</h3>

Do the exercises purposed, using C language. Name each one of the programs as "programa1", "programa2", etc. Then, upload at http://fatecsjc-prd.azurewebsites.net/moodle/mod/assign/view.php?id=4931 with a zipped archive name as your_name.zip, with the programs. Warning: Do not forget to add a main function without:
